📱 Spam SMS Detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham). Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, the goal is to accurately detect spam messages in real-time.

🚀 Project Overview
Spam messages are a common nuisance and a security risk. Automating their detection improves user experience and system safety.

🧠 Goals:
Preprocess and clean SMS text data

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings

Train classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluate and compare model performance
